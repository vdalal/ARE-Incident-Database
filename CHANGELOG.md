# Changelog

All notable changes to the ARE Incident Database (AREDB) are recorded here: new
identifier assignments, taxonomy changes, coverage-flag and status updates, and
governance changes.

Per [`GOVERNANCE.md`](GOVERNANCE.md), identifiers are immutable. They are never reused
or removed, so this log only ever adds to the historical record. A correction changes
an entry's content or its status (`confirmed` / `disputed` / `withdrawn`), never its id.

Dates are ISO-8601 (UTC). The format loosely follows Keep a Changelog.

## [Unreleased]

The founding batch. Nothing is published yet; at the first public release this section
becomes the initial dated release.

### Assigned
- Published founding set: **32 entries** = 25 coverable incidents (23 covered, 2 partial,
  Severity-1 coverable closed at 15 / 15) + 7 boundary exemplars, each mapped to its OWASP
  ASI category.

### Repositioned onto OWASP ASI (2026-07-07)
- Every incident now leads with its **OWASP ASI** category (ASI01 through ASI10) plus a
  Layer-0 repro flag. AREDB indexes onto the OWASP taxonomy rather than claiming its own
  (see `RELATION-TO-STANDARDS.md`).
- Slimmed from 63 to 32: removed 31 weakly-sourced or OWASP-redundant rows.
- AgentX covers **6 of the 10** ASI categories at the action layer; the four it does not
  are named honestly in the README.

### Taxonomy
- Established the two-axis taxonomy (see [`TAXONOMY.md`](TAXONOMY.md)): `failure_mode`
  (what happened) by `confusion_vector` (why it happened).
- Pre-registered 10 emerging `failure_mode`s and 5 emerging `confusion_vector`s as
  slots. A slot asserts no coverage until a real incident is catalogued under it and
  honestly flagged.
- Set `taxonomy_version` to `1.0` (in `data/incidents.yaml` meta) so consumers can pin
  against the axes; it increments when a mode or vector is added.

### Governance
- Established the ARE Numbering Authority (ANA) as the root registrar, on the CVE /
  MITRE model (see [`GOVERNANCE.md`](GOVERNANCE.md)).
- Adopted the honesty rule: no entry is flagged `covered` without a passing repro on
  attribution, applied most strictly to AgentX itself.
- Added the entry `status` field (`confirmed` / `disputed` / `withdrawn`) so a disputed
  or withdrawn entry is marked in place and its id always resolves.

### Licensing
- Data under CC BY 4.0; tooling under MIT.
